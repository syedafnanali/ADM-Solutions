          <hr>
          <p>
            In these days of economic recession, millions of people are compelled to live a life going from one
            paycheck to another for fulfilling expenditures. Nowadays, thousands of people are knee deep in debt and
            are desperate to get out of this situation. In dire financial state, most people think that filing a
            bankruptcy is the only way out. If you are also one of them, stop! The recent amendment in bankruptcy laws
            has completely changed the scenario. Now bankruptcy is no more a suitable option. Most of the financial
            experts consider bankruptcy as the last option due to its enormous negative impacts. The negative impacts
            of bankruptcy linger on your credit report year after year ruining your entire financial record. The best
            option to get rid of your debt burden is to get enrolled in a debt reduction program. Our financial experts
            have created an effective debt relief program that guides you towards financial freedom. Trust us; forget
            all your worries regarding debt. We are offering you an innovative and effective approach for resolving
            enduring issues regarding unsecured debts, specifically credit card debts. The clients enrolled in our
            credit card debt reduction program are able to settle debts for less than they owed and can save thousands
            in the process. For consumers who are unable to pay high interest rates on their credit cards, debt
            reduction is a great solution because they can become debt free rapidly and cheaply and can easily save
            themselves from intrusive court-mandated controls of bankruptcy.<br><br><br>

          <h2>About us </h2>
          <hr>
          <p>
            Its Who We Are

            Founded in 2007 Credit 1 USA was birthed out of necessity. A huge credit crisis swept the country eroding
            the trust consumers had in the financial sector and transformation was needed. The principles of trust,
            integrity and relentlessness were the bedrock upon which Credit 1 USA was formed. Financial knowledge and
            solutions are the levelers of the playing field.

            We believe it to be our company’s responsibility to equip Americans with the skills, information and
            services required to help them overcome their financial challenges. We strive to make lenders aware of the
            alternatives to denial, and the benefits of offering an “alternative yes.” Strategic alliances with
            businesses for employee benefits, financial literacy, and economic productivity is paramount to true
            long-term financial success.

            Most of our clients learn about credit the hard way, and this is one of the huge gaps that we will fill.
            Benjamin Franklin once stated “An ounce of prevention is worth a

            pound of cure.” Our goal is to make credit repair an option in every lending decision across the USA, and
            offer the best preventative credit education. Successfully achieving this goal will drastically reduce the
            default rates, and improve the credit worthiness of the borrowers of tomorrow.

            This is our mission and these are our tasks, we not only accept it, we welcome the challenge!<br><br><br>

            <h2>Debt Settlement</h2><hr>
            <p class="lead mb-5">Think how your life would be if you could keep 70% of your income. The major hurdle
              keeping you from taking that
              thought and making it real is your approach to debt and saving.
              This is the ultimate battle of give and take. Debt is taking from your bank account, and saving is
              constantly
              trying to protect your finances from the mighty power of debt. Forget everything you know about lowering
              debt,
              and start here <br>CONTROL YOUR DEBT
              You have a choice in the war on debt. You can choose to use credit to put you on a perpetual hamster
              wheel of
              debt, or you can bike your way to freedom. One tires you out, and you never move forward. The other
              propels you
              to a place you desire. Understanding how debt effects your credit score is vital to winning the debt war.
              INTEREST IS NOT IN YOUR BEST INTEREST
              A car costs that $500 per month with bad credit can cost $250 with good credit. That other money goes to
              interest! Knowing Interest is not in your best interest is important. It just costs more to have credit
              problems. Building your credit and borrowing smarter saves you money.
              The average person with less than a 720 credit score loses $5,000 to $12,000 per year in higher monthly
              payments. Give yourself a raise today.

            <p class="lead mb-5">We wake up in the morning knowing that today we will change someone's life forever.
              Everyone should be able to pursue their dreams without the worry of shortage, embarrassment of rejection,
              or fear of losing what they have worked for. Credit repair is more than disputing items on a report, it’s
              literally the gateway to a better lifestyle for someone. We believe that today that someone is you.

              Your credit influences so much, the car you drive, the house you live in, the schools your children
              attend, your student loans, the job you have, insurance rates you get, and most of all the money you have
              in savings.

              It’s safe to say that credit can be life changing. More importantly good credit will change your life.

              The difference between where you are and where you would like to be is your credit score. Everyone makes
              mistakes but, not everyone makes a change. Helping you to responsibly improve and completely understand
              your credit repair, debt management and score building is what we do. Your agents of change is who we
              are!

              We are changing lives one score at a time.</p>

      <h2>How does credit repair work?</h2><hr>
      <p class="lead mb-5">  <h4>How much of a credit Risk are you in?</h4>

        Credit scores are risk scores. It is always the risk of default that a lender analyzes when they decide whether you get the loan. Just knowing about the risk doesn’t solve your problem. Knowing what lenders are looking for when it comes to risk is your solution.
        
        Understanding how the lending system works puts you in control. You will go from lenders qualifying you, to you qualifying lenders. Our credit repair programs are designed to raise your credit scores as quickly as possible while giving you the tools to manage your scores forever.
        
        We understand risk better than anyone. You don’t want a chance to get a loan; you want your choice of loan options. This can only be achieved by preparing yourself and your credit for the approval process.
        <br><br>

        <h4>Our Process is simple</h4>        
        Investigate all information that is detrimental to your credit score and the items you want to challenge
        
        Challenge the information that is questionable or illegally reported. We make sure all information on your credit report meets the highest standard of law, maximum possible accuracy.
        
        Monitor the changes on your credit reports to help you continue progressing toward your goals.
